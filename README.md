# Starbucks is Installing a Needle Deposit Box in Bathrooms

Starbucks bathrooms have had a rising problem with the drugs and syringes that get left behind everyday. In order to combat this issue, Starbucks will be installing needle-disposal boxes inside their bathrooms to create a safer environment for everyone.

>More than 3,700 people signed a petition on Coworker.org, calling for Starbucks to place needle-disposal boxes in high-risk bathrooms.
Starbucks workers reported finding blood and needles in bathrooms, as well as being pricked by improperly discarded needles, risking exposure to HIV and hepatitis.

This [article](https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-workers-petition-bathroom-needle-disposal-boxes-2019-1) focuses on the main points behind this company wide change.
